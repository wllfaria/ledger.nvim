# Ledger nvim

Neovim integration for ledger files, powered by tree-sitter

## Motivation

I'm adept to plain-text accounting, and I use ledger to keep track of my
finances, but I've been wanting some better neovim integration for ledger
files for a while.

This project intends to leverage tree-sitter to get completions, snippets
and other cool features I've missed.

This is a personal side project, so updated might be a little slow.

## Features

- Smarter completion for account names and commodities
- a bunch of other things but I still have to code them
